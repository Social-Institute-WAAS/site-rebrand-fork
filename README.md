# Site rebrand - fork
It's a fork from original repo. Here we simplified project folder structure and gulp file, updating dependencies and improving CSS and JS loading using CDN to every lib.

## Using
Run the flow code:


```
npm install
gulp
```

To build the project, and then, access files via browser or web server.

## Project structure

    .
    ├── app      # All source code goes here! Any alteration will happen here!
    └── build    # The project build goes here. Do not change files here! Any alteration will be lost.
